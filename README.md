Loan Eligibility Predictor 🏦
📌 Problem Statement

Banks and financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications every day. Evaluating each manually is time-consuming and prone to human error.
This project aims to predict whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on various parameters such as income, credit score, age, education, and more.

🎯 Objective

To build an AI-based Loan Eligibility Predictor that:

Analyzes applicant details

Predicts loan approval status

Helps banks, fintech apps, and mock loan assessment tools

Achieves high accuracy using deep learning (CNN)

📂 Dataset

Attributes: Applicant's personal & financial information

Age 🧍

Gender ⚥

Marital Status 💍

Education 🎓

Applicant Income 💰

Coapplicant Income 👥

Credit History 📜

Loan Amount 🏦

Property Area 🌐

Loan Approval Status ✅/❌ (Target variable)

Dataset Source:
You can use Kaggle's Loan Prediction Dataset

🛠️ Project Workflow
Step 1 — Import Necessary Libraries 📚

We utilize Python libraries such as:

NumPy & Pandas → Data handling & manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Visualization

Scikit-learn → Preprocessing, splitting & evaluation

TensorFlow / Keras → To build and train the CNN model

Step 2 — Load the Dataset 📂

Read the dataset using Pandas

Understand the data structure

Check column information and data types

Step 3 — Data Preprocessing 🧹

Preprocessing ensures the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for CNN training. Steps include:

a) Handling Missing Values

Fill missing data using mean, median, or mode based on column type

b) Encoding Categorical Data

Convert non-numeric features like Gender, Property Area, and Education into numeric using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding

c) Outlier Detection & Removal

Use boxplots or z-score methods to remove extreme outliers

d) Normalization / Scaling

Scale numerical columns (ApplicantIncome, LoanAmount) using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler

Step 4 — Split the Dataset 🔀

Training Set: 80% of data

Testing Set: 20% of data

Use train_test_split to ensure randomness

Step 5 — Build and Train the CNN Model 🧠

Even though CNNs are mainly used for image data, here we use them for loan data classification:

CNN Architecture

Input Layer → Accepts applicant data

Embedding Layer → Represents features in vector form

Convolutional Layers → Extracts hidden relationships between attributes

Dropout Layer → Avoids overfitting

Dense Layer → Fully connected layer for learning complex patterns

Output Layer → Uses sigmoid activation for binary classification

Step 6 — Test the Model 🧪

Feed test data into the trained CNN

Evaluate using accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1-score

Step 7 — Predict Metrics & Final Results 📊

Confusion Matrix → Visualizes correct vs incorrect predictions

ROC Curve & AUC Score → Measures classification performance

Accuracy Expected: ≈ 98% with proper tuning

📈 Expected Outcome

Predict whether a loan should be approved or not

Achieve high accuracy (~98%)

Serve as a mock fintech loan predictor
